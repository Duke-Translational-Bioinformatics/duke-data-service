# duke-data-service
This is an open source project for building a "data service" for researchers that allows them to:

1. Have a unified interface for storing and managing research data across multiple internal (enterprise data stores) and external (cloud data stores)
2. Have persistent unique resource locators for their data
3. Have Project-level access control lists (ACLs) to manage collaborators' permissions
3. Generate Provenance according to the W3C specification either programmatically or via a graphical user interface
4. Provide a RESTful API for data storage and management
5. Integrate with containerization technology for managing research computing environments
6. Manage research data workflows
