# Writing Dredd hook handler for new language

## Dredd hooks handler client

Dredd comes with concept of hooks language abstraction bridge via simple TCP socket.

When you run Dredd with `--language` argument, it runs the command in argument and tries to connect to localhost port `61321`. If connection to the hook handling server wasn't successful, it exits with exit code `3`.

Dredd internally registers a function for each [type of hooks](hooks.md#types-of-hooks) and when this function is executed it assigns execution `uuid` to that event, serializes received function parameters (a [Transaction object](hooks.md#transaction-object-structure) or an Array of it), sends it to the TCP socket to be handled (executed) in other language and waits until message with same `uuid` is received. After data reception it assigns received `data` back to the transaction, so other language can interact with transactions same way like [native Node.js hooks](hooks-nodejs.md).

## Language agnostic test suite

Dredd hooks language abstraction bridge comes with [the language agnostic test suite](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd-hooks-template). It's written in Gherkin - language for writing [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/A-Table-Of-Content) scenarios and [Aruba CLI testing framework](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba) and it tests your new language handler integration with CLI Dredd and expected behavior from user's perspective.

## What to implement

If you want to write a hook handler for your language you will have to implement:

- CLI Command runnning TCP socket server
  - [Must return message `Starting` to stdout](https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd-hooks-template/blob/master/features/tcp_server.feature#L5)

- Hooks API in your language for registering code being executed during the [Dredd lifecycle](usage.md#dredd-execution-lifecycle):
  - before all transactions
  - before each transaction
  - before transaction
  - before each transaction validation
  - before transaction validation
  - after transaction
  - after each transaction
  - after all transactions

- When CLI command is executed
  - it loads files specified as CLI server arguments
    - it exposes API similar to those in [Ruby](hooks-ruby.md), [Python](hooks-python.md) and [Node.js](hooks-nodejs.md) to each loaded file
    - it registers functions declared in files for later execution

  - starts a TCP socket server and starts listening on localhost port `61321`.

- When any data is received by the server
  - Adds every received character to a buffer

  - When delimiting newline (`"\n"`) character is received
    - It parses the [message](#tcp-socket-message-format) in the buffer as JSON
    - It looks for `event` key in received object and executes appropriate registered hooks functions

    - When the hook function is being executed
      - It passes value of `data` key from received object to the executed function
      - Hook function is able to modify data

    - When function was executed
      - It should serialize message to JSON
      - Send the serialized message back to the socket with same `uuid` as received
      - Send a newline character as message delimiter

## TCP Socket Message format

- transaction (object)
    - uuid: `234567-asdfghjkl` (string) Id used for event unique identification on both server and client sides

    - event: `event` (enum) Event type
      - beforeAll (string)
      - beforeEach (string)
      - before (string)
      - beforeEachValidation (string)
      - beforeValidation (string)
      - after (string)
      - afterEach (string)
      - afterAll (string)

    - data: (object, array) Data passed as a argument to the function

## Configuration Options

There are several configuration options, which can help you during development:

- `--hooks-worker-timeout`: `5000` - How long to wait for hooks worker to start.
- `--hooks-worker-connect-timeout`: `1500` - How long to wait for hooks worker to acknowledge connection.
- `--hooks-worker-connect-retry`: `500` - How long to wait between attempts to connect to hooks worker.
- `--hooks-worker-after-connect-wait`: `100` - How long to wait between connecting to hooks worker and start of testing.
- `--hooks-worker-term-timeout`: `5000` - How long to wait between trying to terminate hooks worker and killing it.
- `--hooks-worker-term-retry`: `500` - How long to wait between attempts to terminate hooks worker.
- `--hooks-worker-handler-host`: `localhost` - Host of the hook worker.
- `--hooks-worker-handler-port`: `61321` - Port of the hook worker.

See [usage](usage.md) for further details.
